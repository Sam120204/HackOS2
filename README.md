# HackOS2 - ARC Transformation Project

This project tackles the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) challenge, a set of tasks designed to evaluate an AI’s ability to recognize and generalize patterns in a way similar to human intelligence. Through pattern recognition, the project aims to develop a model that can analyze grids of numbers and generalize transformations that apply to unseen cases. 

## Purpose

The ARC Transformation Project focuses on simulating reasoning abilities in AI by enabling it to learn abstract visual transformations from training examples. The core goal is to create a system that, when presented with a set of grid-based tasks, can:
1. **Identify Patterns**: Learn generalized transformation rules from provided training data.
2. **Apply Transformations**: Use the learned patterns to accurately transform test grids that it has never seen before.

This project is part of an initiative to advance AI's ability to tackle open-ended reasoning tasks and to measure its performance on abstract problem-solving in a human-comparable way.

## Key Features

- **Pattern Recognition**: Utilizes AI to derive a unified transformation pattern from a set of training grids, providing insight into visual transformations without manual input.
- **Automated Transformation Application**: Once a transformation pattern is identified, it is applied to new test grids, producing predicted outputs.
- **Flexibility**: Designed to be adaptable across different tasks within the ARC dataset, making it possible to evaluate various transformation rules and complexities.

## Project Structure

The project consists of several main components:
- **Data Loading**: Imports and manages ARC datasets for training and testing.
- **Transformation Generation**: Uses AI to extract generalized transformation rules from training examples.
- **Prediction**: Applies the learned transformations to test cases to predict the correct output.

## Requirements

To run the project, you’ll need:
- **Python 3.x**
- An **OpenAI API key** to access the necessary models for generating and applying transformations.
- Additional dependencies, which can be installed using:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
